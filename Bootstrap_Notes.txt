Grid System:::
It is used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns. It consists of 12 columns.

1. 3 column layout using grid system( 2:8:2)
leftside bar, main content area, right side bar

Bootstrap grid classes are divided as per the devices:
mobile devices-- .col-xs-*
tablets-- .col-sm-*
Desktops-- .col-md-*
large desktops-- .col-lg-*

To create a grid layout, we need to follow three simple steps:
1. create container in a divided
2. create a row within container
3. create 3 columns in a row(*- number of columns u need in each block)

**to get good layout we need to add container then inside it row and then below the column class.

If we use one device column class, then it automatically sets for the larger and smaller devices than that.
If we need specifically for larger or smaller, we need to add that class coulmn.

Grid Column Offset:::
when creating website layouts using the grid system, you may want to move grid columns to the right for 
alignmnet purpose.
we have Bootstrap Offset Classes like--
.col-xs-offset-*
.col-sm-offset-*
.col-md-offset-*
.col-ls-offset-*

If we need 2 cols in one row and 4 in another, we can use two div's. But if we need to center the two
columns in first row, then we need offset required number of columns.

**rows and columns can be placed inside an exsiting column.

Bootsrap classes on images::
img-responsive, image will resize itself in according to all devices.
pull-left, image pulled to the left and the text will then flow around the image.
pull-right, image pulled to the right and the text will then flow around the image.
center-block, image will be centered.
